# Student Comments from Week 1

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- "going through students code together and fixing / improving it"
- TAs being very available
  - "I liked how they didn't just tell us how to do it, but helped us figure it out ourselves."
  - "they even sacrificed their lunchtimes to help me out"
- Video Recordings
- "I would not have known of the importance of the pair programming concept without being if I had not gone to a boot camp. Nor would I have bothered with Github."

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- "the lectures of code201 are fit for someone who has some coding background or maybe took code102.  I felt like lectures went really fast for my speed, and I didn't get much from them."
- "I wish there was more 1:1 time built in ...  feel kind of bad that i am monopolizing the TA's time while they are helping me through a section."
- "the everyday journal that I am doing. Although they are great at sorting out my thoughts at the end of the day, those thoughts were already in my head before this bootcamp"
- Confusion surrounding accountability partners
- "I know I've learned a lot, but I still can't see it in my work. That's very frustrating."

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- "I do worry that I won't fully absorb the material with how much I am struggling to keep up."
- "One suggestions that I have is for the instructor to often call random people in the class to answer questions because often enough, there are a few people in the class that always answer the questions and I think it sort take away chances of other people in the class who are maybe a little shy to be more comfortable speaking in class."
- "More whiteboarding and planning before coding"
- "Just hope we will have some extra time to sit down together and just hangout and drink!"
